            <h1>Concept Pip Boy</h1>
            <p>Challenged by Erica of the Creative Element to put what I learnt from their month of CAD lessons to the test by making her a to scale version of a Fallout Pip Boy</p>
            <p>In order to impose greater restrictions on myself I went with a MK1 proof of concept design that was shown on page 19 of "The Art of Fallout 4" as this was a variant I couldn't find any version of that had already been posted online and so would force me to make everything from scratch.</p>

            <h3>My insights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This was quite a daunting task after so few lessons but as it was from an IP I loved I was all too keen to figure it out. In doing so I feel I've learnt a lot more about how to use Fusion 360</li>
                <li>I highly recommend anyone that wants to learn Fusion 360 pick a project like this that they love as it will encourage you to push through any learning obstacles you come across</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reasons why we should build this</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Step one in Erica having a full Wasteland Wanderer cosplay for the next Supanova ;)</li>
            </ul>
